LLM Used: Claude code

Use cotnext7 to read the cloudfare workers documentation and come up with project ideas that can show an impressive skill set and technical ability.
Requirements: LLM (recommend using Llama 3.3 on Workers AI), or an external LLM of your choice
Workflow / coordination (recommend using Workflows, Workers or Durable Objects)
User input via chat or voice (recommend using Pages or Realtime)
Memory or state
This can be something small that can have an impact on a group like students


I will go ahead with the code review agent idea. I envision this as a webapp that has textbox for code input, and users can press enter for the reviewed code. Later, we will try to make this live via a websocket connection, where everything getting typed into a code review box will be dynamically reviewed by my agent. Again, read documentation on cloudfare worker and durable objects on context7 and give specific code suggestions applying these concepts to my project while setting up my repository.
